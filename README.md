# Big-Mart-Stores-Sales-Prediction


# Description: 
The project is about building a system that can predict future 
customer demand for products in stores. By analysing past 
selling records of a particular product. Big shopping malls are 
kept records of selling their product to forecast future demand. 
It helps to manufacture and product warehouse for storing a 
quantity of products. The main goal here is to analyse the past 
record and find a meaningful relationship between different 
attributes and build a system that can do predictions of how 
much a particular product will be in demand. This system will 
help to manage to store capacity of warehouses.


## Data Description:
### Total Number of Records = 14204 
### Total Number of Features = 12
